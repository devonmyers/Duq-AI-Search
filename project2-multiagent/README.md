In this project, the multiAgents.py file was updated to implement agents for the classic Pacman game, with ghosts and food pellets.
Several different types of agents were designed:

--Reflex Agent: An agent that avoids ghosts and takes actions to eat food and increase its score

--Minimax Agent: An agent designed using the minimax decision theory algorithm; tries to minimize losses and maximize gains

--Alpha-Beta Agent: An agent that uses alpha-beta pruning to make the minimax algorithm run more efficiently

--Expectimax Agent: An agent that uses expectimax algorithm, which accounts for probabilistic behavior and suboptimal choices
