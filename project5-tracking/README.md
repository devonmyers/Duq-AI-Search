This project consisted of constructing Pacman agents that hunt down ghosts based on (sometimes noisy) sensor readings.

In bustersAgents.py, the chooseAction method in the GreedyBustersAgent class was written so that a agent following a greedy approach would always choose the action 
that moves the agent closer to a ghost.

On the other hand, inference.py contains code to implement particle filtering.
