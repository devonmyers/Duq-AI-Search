In valueIterationAgents.py, code was written to implement RL agents to find optimal policies to an MDP by value iteration.
Similarly, qLearningAgents.py contains code that was written to implement an RL agent that learns an optimal policy for an MDP from Q-learning, which is based on trial-and-error.
Also in qLearningAgents.py is code that implements an approximate Q-learning agent.
