For this project, two files were edited to implement different search functionality.
In search.py, code for implementing breadth first, A*, iterative deepening, and limited depth first search was added.
In searchAgents.py, code to solve the Corners problem (visiting each of the four corners in a Pacman-esque maze) was added.
Note that this functionality can be used in a Conda shell and executing the commands as described in the folliwing link: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su20/project1/#introduction.
