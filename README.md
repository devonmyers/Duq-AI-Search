# Duquesne AI Coursework

Completed as part of Duquesne's Artificial Intelligence course in the Computational Mathematics and Statistics program, which used assignments from UC Berkley's AI course. Course content was forked from UC Berkley's AI course. Most of assignments involved Pacman-esque problems, both deterministic and stochastic,  where the GUI and base agent code was given.  Actual implementation of problem solutions is described in each project folder.

Code can be downloaded and used in a Conda environment using Python 2.
